# ðŸŽ¯ Speech Recognition and AI Improvements

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Speech-to-Text Accuracy Problems
**Root Causes:**
- Using `latest_long` model (optimized for long audio, not real-time)
- No confidence filtering for low-quality transcriptions
- Suboptimal speech recognition configuration
- Missing sample rate specification for raw PCM data

**Solutions Applied:**
- âœ… **Changed to `latest_short` model** - Better for real-time speech
- âœ… **Added confidence filtering** - Filter out results below 0.3 confidence
- âœ… **Enhanced speech config** - Added `useEnhanced: true` for better accuracy
- âœ… **Improved audio handling** - Better sample rate detection and specification
- âœ… **Added detailed logging** - Debug speech recognition issues

### Issue 2: AI Setting PWM When No Speech Intent
**Root Cause:**
- AI was changing PWM values even for non-motor-related speech
- No intent detection for motor control commands

**Solutions Applied:**
- âœ… **Enhanced LLM prompt** - Clear rules about when to change PWM
- âœ… **Added intent detection** - AI now detects if speech is motor-control related
- âœ… **PWM preservation** - Keep current PWM when no motor intent detected
- âœ… **Better validation** - Only change PWM when clear intent is detected

## ðŸš€ Improvements Made

### Speech Recognition Enhancements
```javascript
speechConfig = {
    encoding: 'LINEAR16',
    model: 'latest_short',        // Better for real-time
    useEnhanced: true,            // Higher accuracy
    enableWordConfidence: true,   // Get confidence scores
    audioChannelCount: 1,         // Mono audio
    sampleRateHertz: 16000       // Explicit for raw PCM
}
```

### AI Intent Detection
```javascript
// New LLM prompt includes:
- Motor control keywords detection
- Clear rules for PWM changes
- Intent detection (true/false)
- Examples of motor vs non-motor speech
```

### Response Improvements
```javascript
{
    success: true,
    transcription: "turn it up",
    response: "I'll increase the speed",
    newPwmValue: 150,
    intentDetected: true,         // NEW: Intent detection
    confidence: 0.95,             // NEW: Speech confidence
    detectedLanguage: "en-us"     // NEW: Language detection
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Expected Improvements

### Speech Recognition
- **Better accuracy** for real-time voice commands
- **Confidence filtering** removes unclear transcriptions
- **Enhanced model** provides more accurate results
- **Better audio handling** for various formats

### AI Behavior
- **Smart PWM control** - Only changes when motor intent detected
- **Preserved values** - Keeps current PWM for non-motor speech
- **Intent awareness** - Distinguishes motor commands from general speech
- **Better responses** - More contextually appropriate

## ðŸ“‹ Test Scenarios

### Motor Control Intent (Should Change PWM)
- "turn it up" â†’ PWM increases
- "make it slower" â†’ PWM decreases  
- "stop" â†’ PWM = 0
- "faster" â†’ PWM increases

### Non-Motor Speech (Should Keep Current PWM)
- "hello" â†’ PWM unchanged
- "what time is it" â†’ PWM unchanged
- "how are you" â†’ PWM unchanged
- Unclear/garbled speech â†’ PWM unchanged

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

Deploy the updated function:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:speechToTextWithLLM
```

Then test with voice commands to see:
- âœ… Better speech recognition accuracy
- âœ… Smarter PWM control decisions
- âœ… Preserved PWM for non-motor speech
- âœ… Better error handling and logging
