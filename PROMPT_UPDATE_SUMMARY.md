# Simplified Human Command Focus - Prompt Update Summary

## Problem Identified
When motor sounds are transferred to the API, the AI transcribes them as "motor sound" but still sets a new PWM value. This causes unwanted motor behavior changes when the system should only react to human commands.

## Root Cause
The original prompt focused on detecting "motor control intent" but didn't explicitly exclude non-human sounds like motor noise, mechanical sounds, or background noise.

## Solution Implemented

### Simplified Prompt Logic
1. **Human Command Focus**: Emphasize only reacting to clear human voice commands
2. **Simple Rule**: If not a clear human motor command, keep current PWM unchanged
3. **Clean Instructions**: Removed technical details and specific sound mentions
4. **Streamlined Response**: Simplified JSON response format

### Key Changes in `/functions/index.js`

#### Before:
```javascript
Instructions:
1. Listen to the audio and understand what the user is saying
2. Determine if they want to control the motor
3. If motor control is intended, calculate the appropriate PWM value
4. If no motor control is intended, keep the current PWM value
```

#### After:
```javascript
IMPORTANT: Only react to clear human voice commands. If you don't hear a human speaking a motor control command, keep the current PWM value unchanged.

Instructions:
1. Listen for human voice giving motor control commands
2. If you hear a clear human command to control the motor, set intentDetected to true and adjust PWM
3. If you don't hear a clear human motor command, set intentDetected to false and keep current PWM
4. Only change PWM values for actual human motor control requests
```

### Simplified Response Format
Clean, focused JSON response:

```javascript
{
  "intentDetected": true/false,
  "transcription": "what you heard",
  "pwm": number (0-255),
  "response": "your response",
  "confidence": number (0-1)
}
```

### Example Scenarios

| Audio Input | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Motor buzzing | ❌ Sets new PWM | ✅ Keeps current PWM |
| Human: "turn it on" | ✅ Sets PWM 150 | ✅ Sets PWM 150 |
| Background noise | ❌ Might change PWM | ✅ Keeps current PWM |
| Human: "what's weather" | ✅ Keeps current PWM | ✅ Keeps current PWM |

## Testing Results
All test cases pass with the updated prompt logic:
- ✅ Motor sounds are ignored (PWM unchanged)
- ✅ Human commands are processed correctly
- ✅ Background noise is handled properly
- ✅ Non-motor human speech maintains PWM

## Deployment
The updated prompt has been implemented in both:
- Regular processing mode
- Streaming mode

## Benefits
1. **Prevents Unwanted Motor Changes**: Non-human audio no longer triggers PWM changes
2. **Simplified Logic**: Clear, easy-to-understand instructions for the AI
3. **Improved Reliability**: System only responds to actual human commands
4. **Cleaner Implementation**: Removed technical complexity and specific sound mentions
5. **Maintains Functionality**: All existing human voice commands continue to work

## Files Modified
- `/functions/index.js` - Updated `directAudioToPWM` function prompt logic
- Added test file to verify prompt behavior

The system should now correctly ignore motor sounds while maintaining full responsiveness to human voice commands.
