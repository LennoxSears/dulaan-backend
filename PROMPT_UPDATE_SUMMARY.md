# Motor Sound Handling - Prompt Update Summary

## Problem Identified
When motor sounds are transferred to the API, the AI transcribes them as "motor sound" but still sets a new PWM value. This causes unwanted motor behavior changes when the system should only react to human commands.

## Root Cause
The original prompt focused on detecting "motor control intent" but didn't explicitly exclude non-human sounds like motor noise, mechanical sounds, or background noise.

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Prompt Logic
1. **Human Voice Detection First**: The AI must first determine if the audio contains human speech
2. **Explicit Non-Human Exclusion**: Clear instructions to ignore motor sounds, mechanical noise, buzzing, humming
3. **PWM Preservation**: When non-human audio is detected, maintain the current PWM value
4. **Audio Type Classification**: Added `audioType` field to response for better debugging

### Key Changes in `/functions/index.js`

#### Before:
```javascript
Instructions:
1. Listen to the audio and understand what the user is saying
2. Determine if they want to control the motor
3. If motor control is intended, calculate the appropriate PWM value
4. If no motor control is intended, keep the current PWM value
```

#### After:
```javascript
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ONLY respond to HUMAN VOICE commands - ignore all non-human sounds
2. If you detect motor sounds, mechanical noise, buzzing, humming, or any non-human audio, set intentDetected to FALSE and keep current PWM
3. Only change PWM values when you clearly hear a human speaking motor control commands
4. If the audio contains only motor sounds, background noise, or unclear audio, maintain the current PWM value

Audio Analysis Steps:
1. First, determine if the audio contains human speech or just motor/mechanical sounds
2. If it's motor sounds, noise, or unclear audio → intentDetected: false, keep current PWM
3. If it's human speech → analyze for motor control intent
4. Only change PWM for clear human motor control commands
```

### Enhanced Response Format
Added `audioType` field to help with debugging and monitoring:

```javascript
{
  "intentDetected": true/false,
  "transcription": "what you heard",
  "pwm": number (0-255),
  "response": "your response",
  "confidence": number (0-1),
  "audioType": "human_speech" or "motor_sound" or "background_noise" or "unclear"
}
```

### Example Scenarios

| Audio Input | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Motor buzzing | ❌ Sets new PWM | ✅ Keeps current PWM |
| Human: "turn it on" | ✅ Sets PWM 150 | ✅ Sets PWM 150 |
| Background noise | ❌ Might change PWM | ✅ Keeps current PWM |
| Human: "what's weather" | ✅ Keeps current PWM | ✅ Keeps current PWM |

## Testing Results
All test cases pass with the updated prompt logic:
- ✅ Motor sounds are ignored (PWM unchanged)
- ✅ Human commands are processed correctly
- ✅ Background noise is handled properly
- ✅ Non-motor human speech maintains PWM

## Deployment
The updated prompt has been implemented in both:
- Regular processing mode
- Streaming mode

## Benefits
1. **Prevents Unwanted Motor Changes**: Motor sounds no longer trigger PWM changes
2. **Better Audio Classification**: Clear distinction between human and non-human audio
3. **Improved Reliability**: System only responds to actual human commands
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: `audioType` field helps identify audio classification issues
5. **Maintains Functionality**: All existing human voice commands continue to work

## Files Modified
- `/functions/index.js` - Updated `directAudioToPWM` function prompt logic
- Added test file to verify prompt behavior

The system should now correctly ignore motor sounds while maintaining full responsiveness to human voice commands.
