## Complete Cleanup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set your project ID
PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

echo "ðŸ§¹ Starting cleanup of Google Cloud deployments..."

# Clean up Cloud Run
echo "Cleaning up Cloud Run services..."
gcloud run services list --region=europe-west1 --format="value(metadata.name)" | grep dulaan | xargs -I {} gcloud run services delete {} --region=europe-west1 --quiet

# Clean up Container Images
echo "Cleaning up container images..."
gcloud container images list --repository=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID --format="value(name)" | grep dulaan | xargs -I {} gcloud container images delete {} --force-delete-tags --quiet

# Clean up App Engine versions (keep default)
echo "Cleaning up App Engine versions..."
gcloud app versions list --filter="traffic_split=0" --format="value(id,service)" | while read version service; do
  if [ "$service" != "default" ] || [ "$version" != "$(gcloud app versions list --service=default --filter='traffic_split>0' --format='value(id)')" ]; then
    gcloud app versions delete "$version" --service="$service" --quiet
  fi
done

# Clean up Cloud Build triggers
echo "Cleaning up Cloud Build triggers..."
gcloud builds triggers list --format="value(id,name)" | grep dulaan | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs -I {} gcloud builds triggers delete {} --quiet

echo "âœ… Cleanup completed!"
echo "Note: App Engine application itself was not deleted (requires manual action)"
echo "Note: Check for any remaining resources manually"
```

## Verification

After cleanup, verify everything is removed:

```bash
# Check Cloud Run
gcloud run services list

# Check Container Registry
gcloud container images list

# Check App Engine
gcloud app versions list

# Check Cloud Build
gcloud builds triggers list

# Check Firewall Rules
gcloud compute firewall-rules list | grep dulaan

# Check billing to ensure no ongoing charges
gcloud billing accounts list
```

## Important Notes

1. **App Engine Application**: Cannot be deleted, only disabled (irreversible)
2. **Billing**: Check your billing dashboard after cleanup
3. **Logs**: Cloud Logging data may still exist and incur charges
4. **Backups**: Make sure you have backups of any important data
5. **DNS**: Update any DNS records pointing to old services

## Cost Monitoring

```bash
# Check current month's billing
gcloud billing accounts list
gcloud billing projects describe PROJECT_ID

# Set up billing alerts (recommended)
gcloud alpha billing budgets create \
    --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID \
    --display-name="Dulaan Project Budget" \
    --budget-amount=10USD \
    --threshold-rule=percent=50 \
    --threshold-rule=percent=90
```
